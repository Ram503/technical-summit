            <div class="stxt">The making of a 21st century Travel Guide Designing a product that collects authentic content from users is challenging and incredibly rewarding with only a few internet players having done this right with quality, and at scale. This talk provides a framework and model for breaking down the User Generated Content puzzle – How can we identify emotions and moments that make users want to thoughtfully contribute their knowledge? How do you convey to a host how good their content is? How can you move from gathering unstructured data to structured data that still feels human. And finally what role does design, research and product play in order get user generated content right? We’ll look at a UGC product journey where many tried and tested approaches were a washout but a few experiments succeeded and paved the way forward.</div>

            <div class="stxt">This talk is for anyone who has asked the question: “How Do We Innovate?”. As more and more software development houses have adopted Agile methodologies as a way of delivering customer value quickly, it has become increasingly difficult to deliver innovation in a world where ‘keeping the lights on’ becomes the de facto for most organisations. How can UX teams learn to revaluate their value propositions whilst making sure that they continue to keep their stakeholders happy?</div>

            <div class="stxt">This talk will look at how we can use the future as a way to better understand people’s needs, desires, and behaviours in the present day. From building ‘provotypes’ — provocative prototypes which investigate the sentiment towards possible future scenarios — to co-designing visions of the future, the talk will show through case studies how the act of anticipating what’s next can create invaluable knowledge and insight to fuel the design of products, services, experiences, and organisations in the present day.</div>

            <div class="stxt">It’s not luck, It’s choice. You’ve probably read that before somewhere on a motivational poster. As with all good arguments, there are two sides. I’ll take you through my lucky punches that only seem lucky in hindsight, and I’ll tell you about some of my worst choices, which turned out to be pretty great. All leading up to where I am today, going from a very poor project manager to team director with responsibility for the customer experience on some of DK’s largest B2B companies, running a successful meetup group for UX’ers and still thinking that 70% must be luck.</div>

I’ll talk about how I went from an agency designer designing for Microsoft to an in-house designer at Microsoft via unconventional means and how you can make your own luck through those same means. What does it take to move from a career as a designer in a PR agency with a creative team of less than 15 to people to designing in-house for one of the largest tech companies in the world? Sometimes unconventional means, like social media, can be your best bet and change your life for the better.</div>
